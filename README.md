This repo contains my customized implementation of the DeepSORT Algorithm. The algorithm uses a YOLO11 model I trained on a custom Dataset to identify Fish, Sharks and Turtles. The Purpose of the project is to better monitor overfishing and bycatch by analysing video footage taken from underwater submersibles. The program also uses Compares the intersection over union of each object found in the video as the video frames progress. By graphing IoU over time the program is able to classify if the objects are moving or if they are still. This functionality is to help the program decide if the object is caught in a finshing net or not.
